REACT is a declarative means just have to tell what we want in ui and react using its reactDom library will build the actual ui , this is declarative paradigm which is different from explicit paradigm which contain alogrithm to control dom creation , for EX u go to artist and u ask him to draw a landscape but dont tell him how to draw it so this is declarative means just tell what the ui should look like but if u ask child to draw a landscape by first draw mountain then river then tree and so on and here u have explicity specify each steps and u control the flow of the landscape that is imperative paradigm .
